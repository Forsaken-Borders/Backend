# Forsaken Borders
Do you wish to have everything grouped together? Concerned that your data is being sold? Want to stay away from the big name companies?

Forsaken Borders is all about security and privacy. All your data is encrypted server-side and double checks the hashes before serving you your content. This protects your information for many basic and intermediate attacks from hackers, while also ensuring those hosting the software is unable to irresponsibly handle your data.

Additionally, with Forsaken Borders being Open Source, this means you can read or contribute to the code! No secrets are held, no data can be sold and no third parties will have access to your data.

# Motivation
Forsaken Borders aims to be not just some web tools, but a whole ecosystem of technology. I currently believe that a large part of the internet is sealed off only to those who have the required money. Money is a huge factor, affecting the quality of the user's experience. I believe that everyone's experience should be the same, regardless of money or status. That's how Forsaken Borders was made, and that's the goal kept in mind when making our services.

# Implementation
The user login service aims to fully comply with the [OWASP Authentication Cheat Sheet Series](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html). Not everything is finished yet. If you feel some features require more attention over others, feel free to open an issue stating which feature and why.
